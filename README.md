This repository contains the software code and data used in the paper titled - "Efficient Feature Engineering Over Unstructured Data for Use with Traditional AI Models". The code is organized into collection of R scripts and instructions for replicating the results are as follows:

**Note:** 

- __Package dependencies__ The software has been tested with R version 4.2.2 and dependency installation is managed by the software itself. However, using newer version of R may require the users to manually install some of the package dependencies needed by the pipeline. In worst case, if the some of the packages have not been updated for newer R versions then those packages (and the models provided by them) need to be manually removed from the list of models to avoid unexpected failures.

- __Expected runtime__ Training all classification models (experiments sections of the manuscript) takes ~5 hours and the actual time may vary depending on the hardware resources of the system on which the program is ran. 


- Following commands should be executed in the terminal/shell/command prompt.
